# JPACRUDProject

### Description
This program allows the user to create, read, update, and delete data from a team roster database. Specifically, a user can add player data, search for a player using player id, edit the data, and delete the data using a website. The changes that a user makes in the website affect the backend database. It is a useful application for keeping track of basic data for a team.

##Technology Used
* Java 
* SpringToolSuite4
* Spring MVC
* Spring Boot
* MacBook Pro
* SQL
* MySQL Workbench
* Mac Terminal
* JPA
* JSP
* HTML

## How to Use

Enter the site and use the buttons and links to find or edit specific player information for players on a team roster. The changes are immediately displayed on the website and also affect the database in the backend.

##Lessons Learned
I enjoyed this project because I see how useful it is. Two of the basic things that we seek to do when using a website is to find information and to share information. This application accomplishes this goal.

I learned how to create a database using MySQL workbench. I then was able to successfully integrate Java with use of the database on a website. I had some initial trouble using JSP mapping, but I was able to discover how to map correctly eventually. I was able to practice JUnit testing for entity mapping.

Overall, I enjoyed this project and plan to use it as a building block for future projects.
